##508 Compliance
**What is 508 Compliance?**
Compliance standards are set by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation act of 1973 that requires federal agencies and government institutions to provide software and web accessibility to people with disabilities.

**Who Needs to be 508 Compliant?**
1.Government agencies
2.Federally funded nonprofits
3.Public higher education institutions
4.Public k-12 schools

**What are Some Basic Standards for Web Accessibility?**
1. Is there a text equivalent (e.g., via “alt”, “longdesc”, or in element content) for every non-text element?
2. For any multimedia presentations, are there equivalent alternatives and are they synchronized with the presentation?
3. Is all information conveyed with color also available without color (e.g. from context or markup)?
4. Are documents organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet? 
5. Are redundant text links provided for each active region of a server-side image map?
6. Are client-side image maps provided, instead of server-side image maps (except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape)?
7. Are row and column headers identified for data tables?
8. Is markup used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers?
9. Are frames titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation?
10. Are pages designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz?
11. Is a text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, provided? (This is to ensure that a web site complies when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way.) 
  11.1 Is the content of the text-only page updated whenever the primary page changes?
12. If pages use scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, is the information provided by the script identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology?
13. If a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, does the page provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with §1194.21, the Technical Standards for Software Applications and Operating Systems, (a) through (l)?
14. If electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, does the form allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues? 
15. Is a method provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links? 
16. If a timed response is required, is the user alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required?

**Simple (Free!) Fixes to Make a Webpage More Compliant (Without Code)**
1. Use clear captions on all images, videos, visual, and audio presentations.
2. Always include clear and understandable headings that provide logical flow.
3. Include text versions of multimedia. This also makes them easily searchable.
4. Make online forms more accessible. Include clear instructions, and field labels on buttons that say “Submit Application” rather than simply “Submit”.
5. Consider linking to text-based versions of infographics. This allows screen readers or other assistive technologies to properly process them.
6. Put more thought into your link text. Be as descriptive as possible. “Click here” and similar phrases don’t give users an idea of where they will be navigating to and screen readers aren’t able to jump from link to link.
